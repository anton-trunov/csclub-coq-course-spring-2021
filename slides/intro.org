# How to make it work with Spacemacs
# 1. Add the following to .spacemacs file
# (org :variables
#      org-enable-github-support t
#      org-enable-reveal-js-support t)
# 2. Use M-x org-reveal-export-to-html-and-browse

* Course outline
- Proof engineering with just the right amount of theory
- Focus on verification of functional algorithms
- SSReflect/Mathcomp architecture
* What is formal program verification?
- A technique providing means of increasing assurance for the correctness of software
  by proving its correctness with respect to a certain formal specification, using formal methods of mathematics
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Formal ~ have a syntax and may be given semantics
* Why is verification important?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Ensure systems are bug-free

* Why is verification important?
- Gain an insight about the system at hand
* Components of formal verification
- Specification
- Implementation
- Formal proof
- Checker
* Formal specification
- A means to describe a system
- Specifying systems is hard and is a form of art!
* Formal proof
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- A formal proof is a proof in which every logical inference has been checked all the way back to the fundamental axioms (A definition by T.C. Hales)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- All the intermediate logical steps are supplied, without exception
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- No appeal is made to intuition, even if the translation from intuition to logic is routine
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- A formal proof is less intuitive, and yet less susceptible to logical errors
* There is lots of formal systems
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Not all formalizms are created equal
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- E.g. to expand the definition of the number =1= fully in terms of Bourbaki primitives requires over 4 trillion symbols
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- With formal proofs one wants as much help as one can get
* Formal methods techniques
The land of formal methods includes
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Interactive theorem provers (e.g. Coq)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Automated theorem provers (SAT/SMT solvers, ...)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Specification languages & Model checking

* What is Coq?
Coq is a formal proof management system.
It provides
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- a language to write mathematical definitions,
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- executable algorithms,
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- theorems (specifications),
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- environment for interactive development of machine-checked proofs.

* Proofs _and_ Tests
- =@vj_chidambaram=: Even verified file systems have unverified parts :)
- FSCQ had a buggy optimization in the Haskell-C bindings
- CompCert is known to also have bugs in the non-verified parts, invalid axioms and "out of verification scope" bugs
* Proofs _and_ Tests
- QuickChick shows an amazing applicability of randomized testing in the context of theorem proving
- Real-world verification projects have assumptions that might not be true

* What is Coq based on?
_*Calculus of Inductive Constructions*_

Just some keywords:
- Higher-order constructivist logic
- Dependent types (expressivity!)
- Curry-Howard Correspondence
* Curry-Howard Correspondence
- Main idea:
  + propositions are special case of types
  + a proof is a program of the required type
- One language to rule 'em all
- Proof checking = Type checking!
- Proving = Programming

* Proving _is_ programming
- High confidence in your code
- It is as strong as strong your specs are (trust!)
- It can be extremely hard to come up with a spec (think of browsers)
- IMHO: the best kind of programming
* Coq as Programming Language
- Functional
- Dependently-typed
- *Total* language
